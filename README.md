## Under construction ## 

This is my 2nd Project. I am focusing on the data collection, data cleaning and data engineering.
An idea for this project is simple. I was always curious of United States since I was a kid. I like to check-up different places, reading information how to live in different states, cities, counties, towns... 
<br>
<br>
I am not trying to re-create the already existing websites like Niche.com, or Areavibes.com, as they are full of the information already. I am trying to use their data (and other sources as well) to get as much information about the places to be able to help people to choose their perfect place to live.

<br>
<br>
This app will contain the following:

1. Websites scraper (Niche.com, Areavibes.com).
2. Google API:
   * Restaurants, Pubs, Cafes information and density in the near distance of the areas. 
   * Distance and commute time to work from the area.
3. Climate information for each area.
4. Flask Website.

<b>NOTE 1: This will not be fully functioning website as Niche, or Areavibes, because to do so I'd need accesses to paid APIs, or pay for datasets. As this is only learning project I just focus on the process itself. 
If one will ever be interested in building something similar, most of the code will be useful to take.</b>

<b>NOTE 2: `config.yml` is not uploaded, as it has api keys and passwords, so you need to create it yourself.</b>
