## Under construction ## 

This is my 2nd Project in my journey to learn Data Science/Machine learning. I am trying to focus on the data collection, data cleaning and data engineering.
An idea for this project is simple. I was always dreaming of moving to United States since I was a kid. I like to check-up different places, reading information how to live in different states, cities, counties, towns... 
<br>
<br>
I am not trying to re-create the already existing websites like Niche.com, or Areavibes.com, as they are full of the information already. I am trying to use their data (and other sources as well) to get as much information about the places to be able to help people to choose their perfect place to live.
<br>
<br>
This app will contain the following functions:

1. Websites scraper (Niche.com, Areavibes.com, more to come).
2. Google API:
   * Restaurants, Pubs, Cafes information and density in the near distance of the areas. 
   * Distance and commute time to work from the area.
   * More to come...
3. Possibly more to come, but not sure yet.


Once I gather all necessary data that will fit my methodology I will create the Website with the following:

1. Questionnaire to fill that will enable perfect place predictor.
2. Top choices and text generator to explain the choice.
